## How to build

The project uses gulp for development and generating dist files.

Start by navigating to the project folder in a terminal and write ***npm install*** to download all dependencies.

Type ***gulp*** to launch a live reload server on port 8080 (can be changed in gulpfile.js).

Type ***gulp build*** to only generate dist files.

Both commands output files to *./dist*.
